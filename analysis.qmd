Public opinion polls [have been used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver) to predict election outcomes.  We will use statistics to predict the proportion of voters that will vote for  Biden in the Nov election using data from a YouGov survey of 1,559 U.S. adult citizens conducted in March 2024.
